The primary goal of this project is to develop an anomaly detection system and predictive model for multivariate time series data, focusing on identifying instability in signals, classifying the type of instability, detecting the root cause (i.e., the first signal to show instability), and analyzing the pattern of instability propagating from one channel to another. The system will use advanced algorithms to analyze the data, detect anomalies, and suggest possible root causes with a focus on using explainable AI and predictive modelling. The scope includes downloading and studying the dataset, researching existing models, developing new algorithms, and implementing an end-to-end pipeline for signal prediction, anomaly detection, classification, and reporting.
